### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tyvan, thanks for visiting my Github!

Software engineering revealed a world filled with limitless opportunities. My curiousity and knack for problem solving naturally drew me to this field. Reach out! I'd love to be a part of your innovative solution.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [LockedIn](https://github.com/tyvancheng/LinkedIn-Clone)! A LinkedIn clone built with Rails and React.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on your next big idea!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Nursing, EMS, or firefighting! The pursuit of knowledge is an endless voyage.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email me at tyvancheng@gmail.com or send me a message through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyvan-cheng-7431748b/)!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy running and playing golf, where the greatest adversary to overcome is the mind. Overcome that hurdle and the possibilities are endless!
